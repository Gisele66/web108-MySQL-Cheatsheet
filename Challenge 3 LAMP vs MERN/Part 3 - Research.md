# Part 3 - Research

## Overview - These are my own words and the Agent cleaned up the formatting for me.

MERN and LAMP are both full stacks but they're built on different philosophies:
- **MERN** focuses on JavaScript and modern applications
- **LAMP** focuses on simplicity and stability with established server-side patterns

---

## Workflow

### MERN
- Uses JavaScript across the entire stack (front and back end)
- Fast for building interactive user interfaces
- Requires more tools and setup

### LAMP
- Uses PHP on the server, HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend
- Simple and easy to understand
- Fewer tools required

**Tradeoff:** MERN is faster for complex UIs but harder to set up

---

## Data Storage Approach

### MERN
- Uses NoSQL document database
- Flexible data structure
- Easy to change data models

### LAMP
- Uses SQL database
- Structured data with fixed schemas and table relationships
- Strong data integrity and clear relationships
- Schema changes require more planning and migrations

**Tradeoff:** MERN is flexible but not as structured; LAMP is structured but less flexible

---

## Performance and Scalability

**MERN**
- Good for high traffic and real-time applications
- Scales great in the cloud

**LAMP**
- Better for small to medium-sized sites
- Scaling is more limited

---

## Deployment and Maintenance

**MERN**
- More complex to deploy
- More parts to maintain

**LAMP**
- Easy to deploy
- Simple to maintain

---

## Pros and Cons

### MERN
**Pros:**
- One language (JavaScript)
- Great for modern web applications
- Highly scalable

**Cons:**
- Complex to set up
- Harder to maintain

### LAMP
**Pros:**
- Easy to learn
- Stable and reliable
- Simple hosting

**Cons:**
- Not ideal for real-time applications
- Less modern frontend tools
