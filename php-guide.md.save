# PHP Syntax Guide

# PHP Variables:
- are used to store information to use later. They can be text, numbers or results
- they always start with a $
- PHP figures out what they are automatically so you don't need to declare them
- they can be stored once and be reused anywhere in the program
- eg: $name = "Gisele";

# Echo and Print:
- both are used to send output to the browser but echo is faster
- echo can output multiple values at the same time but print can only do once
- most just use echo now as it easier and faster
- echo eg: 
	echo "Name: ", $name, "<br>"
	echo "Age: ", $age;
- print eg: 
	$message = "Hellow World";
	print $message;

# PHP Data Types:
- no need to declare the data type as PHP automatically determines what it is based on the value you assign
- you can do strings, integers, boolean, arrays, objects, etc
- eg: 
	integer - $age = 34; (whole numbers) or a float - $price = 19.99; (numbers with decimals)
	boolean - $isLoggedIn = true; (true or false statement)
	array - $colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];

# PHP Strings:
- strings store a sequence of characters and need to be enclosed in either single or double quotes.
- the difference between using single or double quotes is how PHP is going to handle the variables and special characters you put in the string
- Single Quotes display the text exactly as you write it. 
	- eg: $name = "Gisele";
	- echo 'Hello $name'; 
	- Hello $name is what the out put is instead of putting what the name should really be
- Double Quotations - the variables are processed.
	- eg: $name = "Gisele";
	- echo "Hello $name";
	- Hello Gisele - now it processes the variable to include it in the output.
- Use the single quotes for plain text and double quotes if you want PHP to replace the variables with the values given.

# PHP Numbers:
- uses integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with decimals) and can perform normal addtion, multiplication, division, etc.
- eg: $a = 10, $b = 5, $sum = $a + $b, echo $sum would produce 15.

# PHP Constants:
- constants are values that can't be changed and need to always remain the same. 
- eg: your website name for instance. Use define("SITE_NAME", "Bathroom Busters"); echo SITE_NAME;

# PHP Operators:
- Operators are symbols that you use to do operations on variables and values.
- Us them for math, assignment or comparison operators or logical operators.
- eg: Math (+ - / *), Assignement (= += -=), Comparison (== != >=), Logical (&&
